Please read the entire manual before bugging Kaitnieks.

=================
FAQ done by SporTz.
=================

=================
How do I make the client window transparent?
=================
- This only works with silent mouse on Windows 2000/XP only.

- Once SCAR finds the RS client, press Client > 0% Transparent.

- To see if it worked, press Tools > Show Preview.

- If you make it 100%, the window will remain visible but SCAR
will work even when client is covered by other windows.

=================
How do I make SCAR work with RuneBot?
=================
Step 1 - Open RuneBot, by clicking appletviewer.bat

^^ Does not work with Internet Explorer ^^

Step 2 - Open SCAR.

Step 3 - Press -> Client -> Specify Client Title or use the little icon in toolbar to drag and drop on RuneBot window.

^^ This is needed to show SCAR which window is the one^^

Step 4 - Press -> Client -> Reset Client Title.

^^This would rename the window "Runescape - by Jagex Limited"

Step 5 - Press -> Client -> Specify Client Title.

^^Specify it as "Runescape - by Jagex Limited"

Step 6 - Press -> Tools -> Show Preview.

^^ This is how SCAR sees window ^^

Step 7 - Press -> Client -> Remove Borders and Title.

=================
How do I use the old SCAR scripts?
=================
To do this, you must press "F4" while using RuneBot to fix the map.  The compass MUST be facing North.  Then, run the script.  We know for sure that the lobster caging script works.  :)  Some scripts might not work because of RuneScRapes new fatigue system, but use sleepwalker and many scripts will work with minor modifications.

=================
Runebot does the following tasks:
=================
World Zoom
Chat-Filer Off
Map Fix
Auto Sleep
Auto Fight

^^ For more information view the Runebot readme.txt ^^

=================
SCAR doesn't click
=================
Turn off silent mouse.

Many scripts have mistakes made by the maker, so don't go blaming Kaitneks!

=================
I don't have 32bit colors
=================
Use 24 bit.
