Sleepwalker 6.2 (yea so it was 5.2 but its changed so deal with it :D )
 
New Feature

Hey guys,
A new feature has been added to sleepwalker. Private sleepwalking is now enabled thanks to Med. If you look in the .ini file you will see PRIVATE = false and PNICK.  

If you want to enable private logging. Set PRIVATE to true and then for PNICK put the name of the FO that you want to type for you. 

NOTE: THE NAMES ARE CASE SENSATIVE.
	ie: FO_Dylock <> FO_dylock
	    SW_Dylock <> SW_dylock

The FO person then adds the name of the sleepwalker they are typing for.

And be sure you know the person that is going to be typing for you. Otherwise youll be getting bad words all night long.

NOTE: There is a new panel: http://www.rscheatnet.com/sw/panel.php

Also give a thanks to Vego for allowing old hosting.

Thats it
Until next time,
Dylock
